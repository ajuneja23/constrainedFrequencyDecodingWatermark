# Watermarking Language Models via a Frequency Based Constrained Decoding Mechanism

Constrained Decoding has often been used as a technique to ensure robust structured outputs by language models, but in this project we explore it's usage in the setting of watermarking language model responses as an inference-time technique. A user can ensure that each sliding window of a given size has a maximum frequency of a certain token adhering to user input. Easier utils to create these frequency dictionaries are coming soon.
